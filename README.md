Practical Work in Computer Science for Secondary School

# Purpose of this project

The purpose is to create a collaborative space for working on activities about computer science studied at secondary school.

It is possible to enhance easily this project by checking the spelling; proposing some suggestions by modifying the [wiki](https://github.com/jipic5/TP_informatique/wiki) or adding some activities for a class.

# Proportionality

Different methods for proportionality : 

* coefficient of proportionality
* proportional columns in an array
* relationship between the columns of an array
* [rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-multiplication#Rule_of_Three) 
* [cross-multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-multiplication)


# Repayment of a load

Modelization of the amount of [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate) due per period after a [loan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan).

For each period repayment, the borrower will pay principal and [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest) ([amortization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_(business)) of the loan).
